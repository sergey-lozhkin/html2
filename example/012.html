          The importance of line spacing for UX design comes from the power it has to render a block of text more or less readable.
          Line spacing is commonly measured as a percentage of font size.
          Conventional wisdom is that line spacing of 130%-150% is ideal for readability.
          <!-- In fact, anything from about 120% up to 200% is acceptable, but 140% tends to be the most quoted sweet spot. -->
          <!-- You should experiment to see what looks best with your text. -->
          <!-- There are two main risks when it comes to line spacing: too little, and too much. -->
          <!-- Most serious is having too little space between the lines. -->
          <!-- Setting line spacing at 100% means that letters on adjacent lines can touch, because there’s no additional space between the lines. -->
          <!-- This makes for poor readability and atrocious accessibility. -->
          <!-- It should be avoided at all costs. Setting spacing much below 100% will render it completely unreadable. -->
